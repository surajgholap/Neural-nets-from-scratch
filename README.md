# Neural-nets-from-scratch
Implemented Neural Networks and related algorithms from scratch(without any ML/DL libraries) 
1) Perceptron Training algorithm(PTA) for linearly separable classes with step activation function.
2) Multiclass PTA(for linearly non-separable classes) on MNIST data with step activation function.
3) Implementation of Gradient Descent and Newtons method for f(x, y) = − log(1 − x − y) − log x − log y with domain D = {(x, y) : x + y < 1, x > 0, y > 0}.
4) Linear least squares fitting using Exact solution and Gradient Descent for 50 points.
